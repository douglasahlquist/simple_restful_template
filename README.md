# Programming Challenge  

### Task Description
#### • Implement a Java Web Application that meets the specification of the "Document Storage REST Web Service" below.
#### • Limit the scope to the specification. The only error cases to be aware of are those outlined in the specification.
#### • The web application should be packaged as a WAR and should run in Tomcat and Java 1.8.
#### • Documents don't need to be persisted across server shutdown.
#### • Documents metadata (like file name and size) should be stored in a in memory DB 

### Implement the below service using Spring Boot & Java 8.

#### Document Storage REST Web Service Specification
- The Document Storage Service is a simple RESTful web service that allows clients to create, update, query, and delete documents. A document can be anything - text, image, pdf, etc.
- A document can be created by sending a POST request with document contents to /storage/documents. The document is simply the HTTP request payload. All content types are supported. The content of the POST response is a unique alphanumeric document ID with a length of 20 characters. The HTTP response has a 201 Created status code.
- A document can be queried by sending a GET request to /storage/documents/{docId}, where {docId} is the document ID issued during creation. The content of the GET response is the document exactly as it was created or last updated. On success, a 200 OK response is sent. A 404 Not Found HTTP response is returned if the document ID is invalid.
- A document can be updated by sending a PUT request with document contents to /storage/documents/{docId}, where {docId} is the document ID issued during creation. The document is simply the HTTP request payload. On success, a 204 No Content response is sent. A 404 Not Found HTTP response is returned if the document ID is invalid.
- A document can be deleted by sending a DELETE request with no content to /storage/documents/{docId}, where {docId} is the document ID issued during creation. On success, a 204 No Content HTTP response is sent. A 404 Not Found HTTP response is returned if the document ID is invalid.
